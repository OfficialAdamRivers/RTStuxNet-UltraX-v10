# RTStuxNet-UltraX-v10

## WARNING

`` This software constitutes a full-spectrum digital weapon. It is capable of mass destruction across digital, cyber-physical, and industrial infrastructure. This repository is intended solely for advanced security researchers with verified clearance and active controlled environments. Unauthorized deployment will constitute a violation of international law. ``

## Overview

RTStuxNet-UltraX-v10 is the most advanced version of the UltraX platform: an autonomous, multi-vector, multi-phase cyber-weapon engineered to target, penetrate, and irreversibly annihilate complex systems across modern digital infrastructure. This version includes 10 distinct destruction-capable modules.

Each module is capable of standalone execution, but is exponentially more lethal when deployed as part of the full payload chain.

## Destruction-Capable Modules

1. Core_dropper.py
Initializes the destruction chain. Deploys multi-layered payloads and bypasses EDR/AV with obfuscated delivery.


2. Skyfall.py
Induces cascading system failure via multi-threaded overloads. Primary attack surface: OS kernel and critical services.


3. file_shredder.py
Obliterates filesystem data with iterative, low-level overwrites. Destroys both local and network-mapped storage.


4. ghost_forge.py
Forensic obfuscation engine. Forges synthetic logs, nullifies digital traceability, scrambles metadata.


5. nuke_em.py
Bootloader-level destruction. Overwrites master boot records, corrupts partitions, bricks hardware on execution.


6. ragnarok.py
Executes terminal destruction logic. Combines logic bombs, firmware corruption, and failsafe locks.


7. scada_suicide.py
Industrial systems kill module. Attacks PLCs/RTUs via raw protocol injections, firmware logic disruption, and memory starvation.


8. the_cleaner.py
Anti-forensics wipe. Erases all runtime evidence, disables system logging, scrubs volatile memory traces.


9. unlocker.py
Forces access into locked system files, protected registries, or secure volumes using bypass vulnerabilities.


10. vortex_leech.py
Self-replicates to all attached drives, mapped shares, and cloud sync folders. Consumes all I/O bandwidth and initiates recursive payload deployment.

## Note: 

This is not a simulation. This is not theoretical. This is the absolute pinnacle of red team destructive capability. Use accordingly.

## Important Notice & Assembly Requirements

`` RTStuxNet-UltraX-v10 is an advanced framework engineered for elite red team operatives, security researchers, and cyber warfare analysts. Due to the destructive potential and national security implications, critical segments have been intentionally omitted or replaced with placeholders. This ensures the tool cannot be weaponized by threat actors or misused outside of authorized, ethical domains. ``

## Some assembly is required. Qualified personnel will need to: 

~ Manually integrate specific payload delivery chains.

~ Replace protected placeholder functions with real-world exploit logic.

~ Understand SCADA interaction layers and bootloader hijack flow.

~ Inject appropriate trigger conditions or access logic where omitted.


`` This is by design and serves as a barrier against irresponsible deployment. Any attempts to operationalize this framework outside of a controlled, lawful, and research-focused environment are strongly condemned. ``
