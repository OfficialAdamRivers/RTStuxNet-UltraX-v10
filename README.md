# RTStuxNet-UltraX-v10
Code name - BlackOut

**Weapon-Grade Red Team Arsenal | Cyber Destruction Platform**

> **WARNING:** This software is classified as a cyber weapon of mass destruction. It is not a simulation, emulator, or theoretical construct. UltraX v10 is a fully operational red-team warfare payload system engineered for autonomous, multi-vector attacks and total annihilation of digital and physical infrastructure targets. Deployment outside of controlled environments may result in irreversible data loss, hardware bricking, legal liability, and sovereign-grade consequences. Use at your own risk.

## **Overview**

RT-Stuxnet-Lab UltraX v10 is the final evolution in full-spectrum offensive cyber operations. Inspired by real-world APTs and military-grade malware, it enables security researchers to study, test, and understand the true scope of a nation-state level digital weapon system.

It is **not sanitized**. It is **not limited**. Every module in this build is fully armed and executable with catastrophic outcomes.

## **Capabilities**

The arsenal is divided across 10 primary modules, each purpose-built for a critical phase in the kill chain:

### 1. `adaptive_exploit.py`

Live OS fingerprinting and adaptive zero-day selection tailored to host architecture and software versioning.

### 2. `delayed_trigger.py`

Timebomb execution with logic-based or calendar-based detonation schedulingâ€”fully obfuscated.

### 3. `bootloader_attack.py`

MBR/UEFI overwrite tools to destroy bootability, load boot-level malware, or execute self-encryption.

### 4. `cam_file_hijack.py`

Simultaneous webcam hijacking and document exfiltration; supports live stream siphoning and offline file caching.

### 5. `exhaust_flood.py`

Maximum memory and resource exhaustion tool; kernel-level stack flooding and infinite I/O buffer loops.

### 6. `wifi_ap_jammer.py`

Disables legitimate Wi-Fi access while launching rogue access points with credential-capture phishing pages.

### 7. `cloud_replicator.py`

Silent propagation into all mounted cloud, backup, and NAS shares; remote execution on sync-paired devices.

### 8. `stealth_wipe.py`

Anti-forensics engine: system logs cleared, memory-resident execution initiated, permanent trace erasure.

### 9. `encrypted_payload_core.py`

Self-encrypting code engine with AES-256 unlock condition; payload stays dormant until flagged.

### 10. `final_blow.py`

Catastrophic detonation logic: recursive disk wipe, firmware overwrite, bootloader destruction. No recovery.
